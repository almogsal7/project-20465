Almog Salegnik Final Project
The final project of 20465 Course in the Open University of Israel, Building Assembly using C.
The project includes two main passes over the source code to ensure accurate processing and assembly of the code.
During the first pass, labels and directives are processed, and the instruction and data counters are updated.
During the second pass, the actual machine code is generated based on the processed information from the first pass.
The project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how assembly code is translated into machine code and executed by the CPU.
